# Code Samples and APIs

## Instructions for Partners

We’ve decided to use GitHub as an easy way for partners to document their APIs and contribute code samples for participants to use. If you want to provide information or code samples for participants to use at Reinvent Transit, here’s what you need to do.

* From your GitHub account, fork the Reinvent Transit code samples and API repo.
* Create a new branch with your contact information or organization name.
* Create a folder to hold your documentation and/or code samples.
* Commit and push your changes back to Github.
* Issue a pull request and we’ll incorporate your materials into the master branch.
* This process will make it easy for partners to add and modify materials that they want participants to use.
